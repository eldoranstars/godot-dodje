# This game is designed for portrait mode, so we need to adjust the size of the game window. Click on Project -> Project Settings -> Display -> Window and set "Width" to 480 and "Height" to 720.

# Also in this section, under the "Stretch" options, set Mode to "2d" and Aspect to "keep". This ensures that the game scales consistently on different sized screens.
